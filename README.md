# About me
Former working in the fields of Cybercrime Investigation, Digital Forensics, Cyber Security related Software Development and after a short interim period working in Cyber Intelligence I eventually stepped into Automotive Cybersecurity Engineering with the desire to continue my work and research in this field started during my studies before.

I'm interested in understanding how things work in detail and how one can improve them. 

I am a Linux and Open Source enthusiast but also began to love my macBook with Unix in its heart.
